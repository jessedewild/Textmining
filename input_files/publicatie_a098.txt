AB  - In silico approach was utilised to identify differentially expressed key hub
      genes during BPH infestation on Bt rice plant, under laboratory conditions.
      Re-analysis of GSE74745 data with in-house R scripts and STRING database reveals 
      that only 5 key hub genes, namely Os05g0176100, Os06g0683200, Os07g0208500,
      Os07g0252400 and Os07g0424400, belonging to cellulose synthase family, are
      differentially expressed and have confidence score >/=0.9 among themselves.
      Conserve domain analysis of all proteins encoded via these 5 key hub genes
      reveals that they have a common cellulose synthase domain, in which
      "Plant-Conserved Region" (PCR) is highly conserved. After binding with other
      domains of cellulose synthase proteins or other accessory proteins, like sucrose 
      synthase, PCR serves as a metabolic channel to deliver UDP-Glucose, which is the 
      main substrate for cellulose synthesis, into the active site of cellulose
      synthase and initiate cellulose synthesis. Simulation study of recently solved
      topological model of PCR [PDB ID: 5JNP] and molecular docking studies of PCR with
      UDP-glucose reveals that, during BPH infestation, in nearby phloem tissue where
      BPH suck sap, there is an increase interaction of UDP-glucose with PCR and other 
      accessory proteins which in turn increases both the stability of PCR and the
      production of cellulose, finally causing callose deposition at that site and
      hence causing longer nymphal developmental period and lower fertility of BPH
      infested on Bt rice. In near future, these differentially identified 5 hub genes 
      could be possible targets for controlling BPH infestation in rice plant under
      field conditions and increasing rice yield globally.
