AB  - OBJECTIVE: Quantify the rates influenza vaccination and RSV prophylaxis for
      children with airway stenosis and/or other disorders and assess impact on
      resource utilization. METHODS: This was a retrospective study with data extracted
      from Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer (DEDUCE) between January 1,
      2006 and December 1, 2017. Children aged 18 years and younger with at least one
      diagnosis code for airway stenosis and/or disorders were included. The index date
      was defined as the first date of airway stenosis/disorders diagnosis. Each
      patient was followed for up to one year after the index date. Influenza
      vaccination or RSV prophylaxis documented within one year of index date were
      included. We defined emergency department (ED) visits and/or hospital admissions 
      related to respiratory diagnoses as the primary outcome of increased resource
      utilization. RESULTS: A total of 2718 patients were included. In our institution,
      our results have indicated that there are fairly low vaccination documentation
      rates of influenza vaccination, RSV prophylaxis, or both provided to children
      with airway stenosis/disorders, 14.1% (389/2718), 1.1% (30/2718), and 0.6%
      (17/2718), respectively, within the first year after diagnosis. Around 5%
      (139/2718) and 10% (269/2718) experienced ED visits or hospitalizations related
      to respiratory issues within the first year after diagnosis, respectively. Among 
      139 and 269 patients with ED visits or hospitalizations, 34 (25%) and 54 (20%)
      had multiple visits, respectively. Very few patients had documented influenza
      vaccination (11/139, 0.4%) or RSV prophylaxis (5/269, 0.18%) before ED visits or 
      hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: There is little available evidence at this time for
      strategies to prevent adverse events or complications in children with airway
      stenosis/disorders. In our institution, our results have indicated that there are
      fairly low documented rates of influenza vaccination, RSV prophylaxis, or both
      provided to children with airway stenosis/disorders in the first year after
      diagnosis. This is an area of significant clinical interest for potentially
      limiting adverse events and optimizing resource utilization for children with
      airway stenosis/disorders.
