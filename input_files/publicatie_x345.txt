AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health challenge. It has been afflicting
      human for thousands of years and is still severely affecting a huge population.
      The etiological agent of the disease is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that
      survives in the human host in latent, dormant, and non-replicative state by
      evading the immune system. It is one of the leading causes of infection related
      death worldwide. The situation is exacerbated by the massive increase in the
      resistant strains such as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensive
      drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). The resistance is as severe that it resulted in
      failure of the current chemotherapy regimens (i.e. anti-tubercular drugs). It is 
      therefore imperative to discover the new anti-tuberculosis drug targets and their
      potential inhibitors. Current study has made the use of in silico approaches to
      perform the comparative metabolic pathway analysis of the MTBXDR1219 with the
      host i.e. H. sapiens. We identified several metabolic pathways which are unique
      to pathogen only. By performing subtractive genomic analysis 05 proteins as
      potential drug target are retrieved. This study suggested that the identified
      proteins are essential for the bacterial survival and non-homolog to the host
      proteins. Furthermore, we selected glucosyl-3-phosoglycerate phosphatase (GpgP,
      EC 5.4.2.1) out of the 05 proteins for molecular docking analysis and virtual
      screening. The protein is involved in the biosynthesis of methylglucose
      lipopolysaccharides (MGLPs) which regulate the biosynthesis of mycolic acid.
      Mycolic acid is the building block of the unique cell wall of the MTB which is
      responsible for the resistance and pathogenicity. A relatively larger library
      consisting of 10,431 compounds was screened using AutoDock Vina to predict the
      binding modes and to rank the potential inhibitors. No potent inhibitor against
      MTB GpgP has been reported yet, therefore ranking of compounds is performed by
      making a comparison with the substrate i.e. glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate. The
      obtained results provide the understanding of underlying mechanism of
      interactions of ligands with protein. Follow up study will include the study of
      the Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs), and to propose the potential inhibitors 
      against them.
