AB  - AIM: An integrated protocol of virtual screening involving molecular docking,
      pharmacophore probing, and simulations was established to identify small novel
      molecules targeting crucial residues involved in the variant apoE epsilon4 to
      mimic its behavior as apoE2 thereby eliminating the amyloid plaque accumulation
      and facilitating its clearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An excellent ligand-based 
      and structure-based approach was made to identify common pharmacophoric features 
      involving structure-based docking with respect to apoE epsilon4 leading to the
      development of apoE epsilon4 inhibitors possessing new scaffolds. An effort was
      made to design multiple-substituted triazine derivatives series bearing a novel
      scaffold. A structure-based pharmacophore mapping was developed to explore the
      binding sites of apoE epsilon4 which was taken into consideration. Subsequently, 
      virtual screening, ADMET, DFT searches were at work to narrow down the proposed
      hits to be forwarded as a potential drug likes candidates. Further, the binding
      patterns of the best-proposed hits were studied and were forwarded for molecular 
      dynamic simulations of 10 ns for its structural optimization. RESULTS:
      Selectivity profile for the most promising candidates was studied, revealing
      significantly C13 and C15 to be the most potent compounds. The proposed hits can 
      be forwarded for further study against apoE epsilon4 involved in neurological
      disorder Alzheimer's.
